# Lovers on a Park Bench
*A game made with much haste for LD33. Left me with a hangover. I had an English exam the next day too...*


'Lovers on a Park Bench' is essentially a typing game following the story of a square, his ex-girlfriend and a series of intense and very-confusing-at-times metaphors and allusions (they're pretty obvious). All of this is topped with narration by award-winning robot voice, Stephen Hawking (or whatever Audacity can do to emulate it).
